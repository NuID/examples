/*******************************
 * Example authentication flow *
 *******************************/

/**
 * `example` uses the 4 previous functions to demonstrate how the individual
 * endpoints interact, and how they can be used in tandem to create a secure
 * authentication flow where no private data is sent over the wire nor
 * persisted server side.
 *
 * NOTE: the input `secret` emulates a user-chosen, potentially low-entropy
 * secret such as a password. Any enforcement of strength requirements must
 * happen on the client, as an authenticating server never learns any
 * information about the underlying secret from which a proof is derived.
 *
 * NOTE: The `example` function below acts as both the "client" and the
 * "server". However, these functions work identically in a browser client.
 *
 * I.e., in a typical deployment, proof derivation happens in the browser
 * as a result of a user entering their login information and pressing "Login"
 * as they normally would. The resulting protocol looks similar to any other
 * asymmetric authentication scheme:
 *
 * 1. the authenticating server issues a challenge
 * 2. proof derivation occurs on the client, using the `password` <input> value
 *    as the input secret
 * 3. the client POSTs the derived proof to the authenticating server
 * 4. the authenticating server verifies the proof and proceeds appropriately
 *
 * The NuID Auth API and the `@nuid/zk` package are meant to make this type of
 * extensible, secure, developer friendly authentication flow easy to implement.
 *
 * NOTE: The protocol can also be made `WebAuthn`-compliant using the Web
 * Credentials API in compatible browsers. A future example will demonstrate
 * this interoperability.
